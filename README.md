# ff_self-modeling
Fourier Features Self-modeling Robots


1. Create a conda environment py3.10
2. install requirements.txt


env.py ---a robot in pybullet simulation



TO DO:
1. Collect robot babblng data: 20k steps.
2. Create two self-models(with/without fourier features mapping) using these data.
3. Evaluate prediction results. 
4. Use such data to achieve MPC control.
